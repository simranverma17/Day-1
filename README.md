# JavaScript: Day-1

This project contains simple JavaScript programs that help beginners understand the basics of:

- Variables
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)

Each script is designed to be easy to read, understand, and run in a browser console or a Node.js environment.
